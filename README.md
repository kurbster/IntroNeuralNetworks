# IntroNeuralNetworks
This is a repo of my work from the Udemy course Neural Networks from Scratch.

### multilayer.py
This is my own implementation of forward and backward propagation. This is what I used for the examples not involving a library.

### XOR.py
The first function is an approximate representation of the XOR operator and the second function is an exact representation of XOR.
